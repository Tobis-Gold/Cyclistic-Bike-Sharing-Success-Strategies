# Cyclistic-Bike-Sharing-Success-Strategies


## Project Overview 

Cyclistic Company is a bike-sharing company in Chicago with more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, I wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
Data insights, I will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Data Source


This primary dataset use for this analysis is the "cyclistic_bike_sharing_may_2024_csv" containing detailed information about the bike type, how both casual and annual member uses the bike, which type of bike they prefer etc.


## Tools

- Excel - Data cleaning, Analysis and Data Visualisation.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation 

In the initial preparation phase, I perform the following tasks
1. Data loading and Inspections
2. Sort and filter the data
3. Handling the missing values 
4. Data cleaning and formatting.
5. Determine the credibility of the data.


## Exploratory Data Analysis 

EDA involved performing some calculation, identifying trends and patterns, exploring the data to answer questions such as 

- Total Number of Causal riders.
- Total Number of Annual Member Riders.
- Preferred and most used Bike Type.
- Most used Bike Type by day.
- Average Ride Length.

## Data Analysis 

Includes the following steps

1. Created a new columns like Rider_Length, Days_of_Weeks.
2. Used some calculation functions to fill in the Columns.
3. Used pivot tables for other data analysis.

## Results/Findings 

The analysis results are summarised as follows 

1. The company has a steady increase of customers from both Casual and Annual Member.
2. Casual riders has the most average ride length.
3. They rides with both Classic and Electric bike.

## Recommendations 

Based on the analysis, I recommends the followings

- Offer some discounts for new and older casual riders.
- Promote the monetary benefits and Cost Comparison, Show casual riders how much they can save over time with a membership compared to per-ride fees.
- Flexible Plans and Offer a variety of membership plans (monthly, quarterly, annual) so that users can select what fits their needs and riding frequency.
- Referral Programs like Giving current members rewards for referring casual riders who convert to memberships.
- Priority Docking by ensuring that registered members have priority docking spots or guaranteed bike availability during peak times.
- Use the company’s app to create a seamless experience for members, with features like advanced booking or reserved parking spaces.
- Encourage casual riders to provide feedback and use that input to improve services, which may help convert them into members.


## Limitations 

The data used is only for the month of May, 2024. Making it difficult to find some pattern like location, payment differences between casual and members rider and if there's monetary differences between classic bike electric bike.
